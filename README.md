The login interface passes the user name and password to the server, and then the server verifies the correctness of the account and password.
Note: As long as the password is 123456, the user is allowed to log in.
#friend interface:
In the friend interface, simply double-click on the buddy number will jump out of the chat interface.
#chat interface:
In the chat interface, the sent message will be displayed in the message bar.
